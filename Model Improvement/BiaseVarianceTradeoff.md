# Bias Variance Tradeoff

The bias-variance tradeoff explains the balance we need between model simplicity and complexity.
- High bias means the model is too simple, leading to underfitting — it cannot capture the true patterns of the data.
- High variance means the model is too complex, leading to overfitting — it captures noise as if it were signal.

The goal is to find the optimal model complexity where both bias and variance are minimized, resulting in good generalization on unseen data.

In practice, techniques like cross-validation, regularization, and ensemble methods help manage this tradeoff.
