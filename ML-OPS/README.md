# 🗓️ One-Month MLOps Learning Plan

This plan will help you learn and practice **MLOps** in 30 days, covering concepts, tools, and one end-to-end project for your portfolio.

---

## 🔹 Week 1: Foundations of MLOps
**Goal:** Understand what MLOps is, why it matters, and set up your environment.

- **Day 1–2:**
  - Read about MLOps concepts (CI/CD for ML, reproducibility, monitoring).
  - Difference between DevOps & MLOps.
  - Learn about ML pipeline stages: data ingestion → preprocessing → training → deployment → monitoring.
  - 📖 Resource: Google’s MLOps whitepaper.

- **Day 3–4:**
  - Install & explore **MLflow** (experiment tracking & model registry).
  - Log metrics, parameters, and artifacts in a simple regression experiment.

- **Day 5–7:**
  - Intro to **Docker** for ML.
  - Package a simple ML app (Flask/FastAPI + model).
  - Push Docker image to **DockerHub**.

---

## 🔹 Week 2: Versioning & Pipelines
**Goal:** Manage data/models effectively, build automated ML pipelines.

- **Day 8–9:**
  - Learn **DVC (Data Version Control)**.
  - Version datasets & models.
  - Practice dataset snapshots with Git + DVC remote.

- **Day 10–11:**
  - Pipeline orchestration with **Kubeflow** or **Prefect**.
  - Build a simple pipeline: preprocessing → training → evaluation.

- **Day 12–14:**
  - Integrate **MLflow + DVC**.
  - Hands-on: End-to-end pipeline with versioned data and experiment logging.

---

## 🔹 Week 3: Deployment & Monitoring
**Goal:** Deploy models in production-like environments.

- **Day 15–16:**
  - Serve models with **FastAPI**.
  - Build REST API → expose prediction endpoint.
  - Containerize with Docker.

- **Day 17–18:**
  - Deploy on **Azure / AWS / GCP** (choose one).
  - Use managed services (e.g., Azure ML Endpoints, AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI).

- **Day 19–20:**
  - Monitoring basics:
    - Log requests & predictions.
    - Concept of drift detection.
    - Tools: **Prometheus + Grafana**, **EvidentlyAI**.

---

## 🔹 Week 4: CI/CD & Final Project
**Goal:** Automate workflows and build a showcase project.

- **Day 21–23:**
  - Learn **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI/CD**.
  - Automate: testing → building Docker image → deploying API.

- **Day 24–26:**
  - Final Project:
    - Take a dataset (e.g., Titanic, House Prices, or Kaggle dataset).
    - Build a full MLOps pipeline:
      - Data versioning (**DVC**)
      - Experiment tracking (**MLflow**)
      - Model packaging (**Docker + FastAPI**)
      - Deployment (**Cloud service**)
      - Monitoring (**EvidentlyAI**)

- **Day 27–28:**
  - Write project **README** + architecture diagrams.

- **Day 29–30:**
  - Revise all concepts.
  - Prepare for interviews:
    - “How do you ensure reproducibility?”
    - “How do you monitor models in production?”
    - “CI/CD for ML vs traditional software?”

## 🎯 Outcome After 1 Month
By the end of this plan, you’ll have:
- ✅ Knowledge of key MLOps tools (**MLflow, DVC, Docker, CI/CD, Cloud**)
- ✅ One end-to-end **MLOps project** for GitHub portfolio
- ✅ Confidence to explain **MLOps practices** in interviews
